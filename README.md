# RX-Care

This is a full-stack application developed using C#.Net and React. The purpose of this application is to provide an easy and efficient platform for doctors to connect with their patients, monitor prescriptions, and ensure medication adherence. The app enables doctors to assign new prescriptions, adjust dosages, and track patients' medication intake. Patients can sign in to the app, check off when they take their medicine, and communicate with their doctors seamlessly.

## Features

- User Authentication: Patients can sign in to the app using their credentials to access their profile and medication information. Doctors can also authenticate themselves to manage patient records and prescriptions.

- Prescription Management: Doctors can create and assign new prescriptions to patients, as well as adjust dosages and schedules. They can also track whether patients are taking their medication properly.

- Medication Adherence Tracking: Patients can mark their medication intake in the app, allowing doctors to monitor their adherence and make informed decisions about their treatment.

- Patient Management: Doctors have the ability to add, edit, or remove patient records, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information is maintained.

- Seamless Communication: Patients can easily communicate with their doctors through the app, making it convenient to ask questions, request prescription changes, or provide updates on their condition.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: The frontend of the application is built using React, providing an interactive and responsive user interface.

- Backend: The backend is developed using C#.NET, which powers the server-side logic and handles data processing.
